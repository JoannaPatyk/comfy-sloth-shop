# The Most Cozy Shop Website

This is a web application for an online store that sells comfortable and cozy home decor items. The project is built using React. One of the website's subpages is dedicated to products and contains several product search filters. Products can be displayed by category, company, color, or by choosing a price range or free delivery. Each product has its own subpage with a description. Products can be added to the shopping cart, which also displays the total cost of purchases.
